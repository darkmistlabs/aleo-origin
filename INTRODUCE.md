# First generation gameplay rules
Players go to different kinds of planet NFTs and name them according to their own conditions.
To form a complete galaxy, the composition of the galaxy needs to conform to the current basic laws of physics and astronomy to unlock Easter eggs Easter eggs have black hole cards, escape cards, stealth cards, detection cards.
The black hole card can steal any celestial body whose energy is not 2 times larger than it, 
of course, the black hole cannot suck away the celestial body it wants to steal at a long distance, and each celestial body will appear in a position with space when it is born,
and the player can choose by himself, because unreasonable entry will cause the galaxy body to be unstable, thus collapsing (destroying) Escape card: After being sucked away by the black body, 
it can be used to get returned. Stealth Card: Performs stealth effects within the effective time without being discovered by black holes. Probe card: Can detect the location of black holes. Each card can only be used once
